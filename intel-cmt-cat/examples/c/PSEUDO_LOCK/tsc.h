 * @brief Get TSC value for the start of measured block of code

 * This function prevents out of order execution before reading TSC.
 * LFENCE instruction is used for it:
 *   - no OOO
 *   - load buffers are empty after lfence
 *   - no deliberate restrictions on store buffers, some stores may drain though
 * Another options to prevent OOO are:
 *   - cpuid; affects LB and SB (both get emptied)
 *   - forced branch miss-prediction; no effect on LB or SB but
 *     loads/stores may drain
 * When measured code has very high cycle cost preventing OOO
 * may not be required and RDTSCP instruction may be enough.
