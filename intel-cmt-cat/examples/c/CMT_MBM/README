OVERVIEW
========

This is example code to demonstrate the use of PQoS/Intel(R) Resource Director
Technology (Intel(R) RDT) library APIs to manage Cache Monitoring Technology
(CMT), Memory Bandwidth Monitoring (MBM). Refer to
https://github.com/01org/intel-cmt-cat/blob/master/README table 1 for a list
of processors supporting CMT and MBM.
CMT_MBM sample application build will create one target as follows:
1. monitor_app - Demonstrates usage of PQoS/Intel(R) RDT library APIs related
to monitoring events like cache occupancy, local memory bandwidth usage and
remote memory bandwidth usage. It operates in user space and uses PQoS/Intel(R)
RDT and C libraries only.
Note: Monitor events are hardware dependent. Only supported event will be shown.


COMPILATION
===========

Note: The PQoS/Intel(R) RDT library should be installed before compilation.

Run "make all" or "make" to compile the program. If compilation is successful
"monitor_app" binary should be present in the directory.

Run "make clean" to clean the build files.


USAGE
=====

To run:
$ sudo ./monitor_app

For more usage options:
$ sudo ./monitor_app -h
